			<p class="p-project">Fearless Flyer is an infinite runner for the Oculus Go. It was a semester-long academic project which I completed on a team of 5 students. You play as an old man in a wheelchair who is getting pulled down the street by a kite. I programmed the world generation, which included randomized spawning of all environment objects and obstacles. I also implemented an upgrade system; each time the player dies, they can purchase upgrades using hard candy and try to get a new record. </p>
