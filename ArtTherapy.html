			<p class="p-project">Art Therapy is my Fall 2021 ETC project. It is a multiplayer VR app for Oculus Quest which will help art therapists do remote sessions with their clients. I am the sole programmer on a team of 4, and the project is made with Unity. In addition to creating a robust multiplayer drawing experience in VR, I am also helping with the design to ensure that the product meets the needs of art therapists. We have simplified the UI and controls down to a minimum in order to let guests jump right into drawing, regardless of their previous VR experience. I recognized that as professional users, therapists in the app should be able to handle more complexity than their clients, so we let the therapist handle actions such as moving clients around the room and wrangling menus. This way, the therapist is transformed from a regular user into a handler who can enhance the app's acccessibility for their clients.</p>
