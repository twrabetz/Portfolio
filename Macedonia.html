			<p class="p-project">What's worse than a worm in an apple? A mind-controlling worm in an apple! Control the fruits to do battle and emerge victorious! If things look like they're going bad, a new fruit host is ripe for the taking!

This is a fruit-themed top-down combat game I am developing as a personal project. It will feature a singleplayer campaign as well as a level editor, allowing users to create and share new levels. I am doing everything including programming, design, art, animation, sound, and music. My goal is to continue developing this project into a full-featured small indie game.</p>
